### Big O Notation

- notation to describe performance of algorithm
- emphasis is on how performance scales with input size
- approximation
- why we use **Big O** is it allows us to compare performance of algorithms regardless of language or environment

### Big-O Simplification rules

- drop any constant factor and smaller terms in a sum

#### Array & String

1. Time complexity of finding a specified key in ***HashMap*** is O(1).
2. If you put same key with different value , only last input is what you can get.
3. If there is no key , what returns is *NUll*.
